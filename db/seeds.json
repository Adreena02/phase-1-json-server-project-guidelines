      "description": "Animals smooth and spiky, fast and slow, hop and waddle through the two hundred plus pages of the Caldecott Honor artist Steve Jenkins’s most impressive nonfiction offering yet. Sections such as 'Animal Senses,' 'Animal Extremes,' and 'The Story of Life' burst with fascinating facts and infographics that will have trivia buffs breathlessly asking, 'Do you know a termite queen can produce up to 30,000 eggs a day?' Jenkins’s color-rich cut- and torn-paper artwork is as strikingly vivid as ever. Rounding out this bountiful browsers’ almanac of more than three hundred animals is a discussion of the artist’s bookmaking process, an animal index, a glossary, and a bibliography. A bookshelf essential!"
